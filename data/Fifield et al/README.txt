In their paper, A New Automated Redistricting Simulator Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, 
Benjamin Fifield, Michael Higgins, Kosuke Imai, and Aleander Tarr test several MCMC redistricting
methods on a small 25 precinct section of Florida. This data, along with their code, can be found
in the redist repository on Github.

This folder contains the results of running our own MCMC (RunDMCMC) on these 25 precincts.
